# Discrete-Event-Simulation-and-Analysis

This folder demoinstrates a practical application of discrete event simulation using Arena Simulation and Optquest to help the retaurant owners deal with operational inefficiencies.
To get a better understanding of what has been done, kindly go through the "Restaurant Model Analysis and Technical Document".pdf file. It details the results, approach as well as the technical implementation of the project.

Hope you find this helpful.
