# Discrete-Event-Simulation-and-Analysis

This folder demoinstrates a practical application of discrete event simulation using Arena Simulation and Optquest to help the retaurant owners deal with operational inefficiencies.
To get a better understanding of what has been done, kindly go through the "Restaurant Model Analysis and Technical Document".pdf file. It details the results, approach as well as the technical implementation of the project.

Discrete event simulation using Arena involves modeling and analyzing systems that involve discrete, distinct events over time. Arena is a simulation software developed by Rockwell Automation that provides a graphical user interface for building simulation models.

In discrete event simulation, you create a model of a system by defining entities, resources, queues, and processes. Entities represent objects moving through the system (e.g., customers, parts), resources represent entities that perform tasks (e.g., servers, machines), queues represent waiting areas for entities, and processes represent activities or operations performed on entities.


Hope you find this helpful.
